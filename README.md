# tl;dr
Very simplistic CRUD app that adds a person's name and email to a table.


This project is basically the same thing and has the same purpose of [this one](https://github.com/danillonogueira/react-hooks-basic).


The only difference is that now the state management is a little more elaborated and makes use of reducer functions.
